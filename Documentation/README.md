# Western Lyon Tram Train

This simulation represents the tram-train network operating from Lyon Saint-Paul station within the western limits of the city of Lyon, France. The network opened in 2012 and is part of the TER Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes system and consists of two local lines:

- Line 21: Lyon Saint-Paul to Brignais
- Line 22: Lyon Saint-Paul to Sain-Bel

## Simulation

The simulation is of medium difficulty and so can be operated at increased time speeds for a greater challenge. It is recommended that the included session file be used as automatic routes have been added, points have been set to correct defaults, and an initial path created for the first service of the timetable which commences immediately.

The map includes accurate signalling and speed limits taken from cabride footage of the line in 2023, and all stations along the network are included:

- Lyon Saint-Paul
